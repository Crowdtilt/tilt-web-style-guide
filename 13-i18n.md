Moving forward with new country releases, it's important to excel in making clients feel at home using Tilt. We depend on the user's locale (ll-RR), a piece of data consisting of their language (ll), and optionally region (RR). 

On desktop, locale detection is priority based. Starting with highest priority:

1. The query parameter 'locale'.
3. The locale in the request path (e.g. `/fr/tilts/new`), if there is one. We are slowly transitioning to this method of detection as being the only one.
4. Locale on the user logged in.
5. HTTP Accept-Language header. A browser sets this for all requests going out, usually based on the settings defined in the browser, but some use OS settings (Safari). Some browsers like Safari may send only one, others may send a list in order of preferences. Many browsers will only send language without region (e.g. 'nl'), so we have to end up making a guess on their region.
6. Default `en-US` locale.

## Formatting
Our goal is to transform every raw value representing time, monetary amount, or integer number, into something a user can recognize as being formatted according to their locale. Examples (for Dutch Netherlands locale):

1. MS since epoch ```1440275194871``` into ```zaterdag 22 augustus 2015 16:26```
2. Monetary USD amount in cents ```123400067``` into ```US$Â 1.234.000,67```
3. Integer value ```1234``` into ```1.234```

In the future, this list will expand to contain formatting of geographical addresses, phone numbers, names, and more.

### General
At the moment, we rely on an implementation (https://github.com/andyearnshaw/Intl.js/) of the standard Javascript object ```Intl``` for formatting currencies and numbers. ```Intl``` is based on ECMA-402 specifications, and although implementation and locale data differs between browsers, a consistent API is something we'll hopefully see eventually. Until then, we'll be using the polyfill in every browser for consistency.

Notes:
* Our formatter utilities and moment localized formatting will use global client locale if not provided explicitly, although moving forward you should not rely on this
* Do not use ```Intl``` or ```IntlPolyfill``` directly (either through the constructors or ```toLocaleString```)
* Our formatter utilities cache constructors and provide an API that establishes consistency

### Currencies
* Imperative: ```CurrencyFormatter```
* Declarative:
    * ```LocalizedCurrency``` an all purpose component which can take any currency code
    * ```UserPrice``` formats according to user's currency code
    * ```CampaignPrice``` formats according to a Tilt's currency code

### Decimal Numbers
* Imperative: ```NumberFormatter```
* Declarative: ```LocalizedNumber```

### Percentages
* Imperative: ```PercentageFormatter```
* Declarative: ```LocalizedPercentage```

### Dates
`moment.js` provides a lot of power in terms of working with dates in general, supports localized formatting and 'time ago' strings. `Intl` is pretty limited here, so we won't be using it.

* Imperative: ```DateFormatter```
* Declarative: ```LocalizedDate``` and ```LocalizedTimeAgo```

### Images
* Aim to use ```LocalizedTextImage``` for all image localization. This involves a non-text background image with text that is marked for translation.
* Use ```LocalizedImage``` otherwise. It is primitive and follows an approach Android to localizing image resources.

### User Inputs
If a user is shown the value ```1.000,50```, he or she likely expects to enter such numerical values in the same manner.
* Use ```LocalizedNumberInput``` to replace ```<input lang="ll-RR" type="number"/>``` which many browsers do not support yet
* Use ```LocalizedFloatField``` to replace the ```FloatField``` field in newforms.
