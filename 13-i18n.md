Moving forward with new country releases, it's important to excel in making clients feel at home using Tilt. We depend on the user's locale, a piece of data consisting of their language, and optionally region. 

On desktop, locale detection is priority based. Starting with highest priority:

1. The query parameter 'locale'.
2. Locale on the user logged in.
3. HTTP Accept-Language header. A browser sets this for all requests going out, usually based on the settings defined in the browser, but some use OS settings (IE). Some browsers like Safari may send only one, others may send a list in order of preferences. Many browsers will only send language without region (e.g. 'nl'), so we have to end up making a guess on their region.
4. Default en-US locale.

On mobile, locale detection is based solely on device settings, but we won't talk about that here.

## Formatting 
Our goal is to transform every raw value representing time, monetary amount, or integer number, into something a user can recognize as being formatted according to their locale. Examples (for Dutch Netherlands locale):

1. MS since epoch ```1440275194871``` into ```zaterdag 22 augustus 2015 16:26```
2. Monetary USD amount in cents ```123400067``` into ```US$Â 1.234.000,67```
3. Integer value ```123456``` into ```123.456```

### General
We rely on the standard javascript object ```Intl``` for formatting currencies and numbers. ```Intl``` is based on ECMA-402 specifications, and although implementations differ, a consistent API regardless of browser is something we'll see eventually. Safari must use a polyfill, as it does not implement the standard at all. 

Few things:
* Our formatter utilities and moment localized formatting will use global client locale (if not provided explicitly - although you should when you can)
* Do not use ```Intl``` directly (either through the constructors or ```toLocaleString```)
* Our formatter utilities (below) cache ```Intl``` constructors and provide an API that attempts to use ```Intl``` in a way that will work consistently amongs all browsers 

### Currencies
* Use our ```CurrencyFormatter``` utilities to format currencies
    * ```formatCurrencyForDisplay``` which will not show decimals if not necessary
    * ```formatCurrency``` which will show decimals regardless
* In React, we have several components for currency formatting (which use the above internally):
    * ```Price``` an all purpose component which can take any currency code and any locale
    * ```UserPrice``` formats according to user's native currency and locale
    * ```CampaignPrice``` formats according to a Tilt's currency and user's locale
    * ```CountryPrice``` (to come) formats according to a countries native currency and user's locale
* Do not use ```accounting.js```, an approach we followed earlier. ```accounting.js``` is not based on locale and relies on the programmer to figure out the symbols, placement of symbols, groupings, and so forth. 

### Numbers
We rely on the ```Intl``` object again.
* Use our ```NumberFormatter``` utilities to format numbers as integers or real numbers 
* Again, do not use ```accounting.js``` as it requires the programmer to specify delimeters and groups, so it's not based on locale

### Dates
```moment.js``` provides a lot of power in terms of working with dates in general, supports localized formatting and 'time ago' strings. ```Intl``` is pretty limited here, so we won't be using it.
* Use ```moment.js``` for for any formatting make sure to use localized formats (e.g. ```moment(date).format('L');``` vs ```moment(date).format('MM dd');```
