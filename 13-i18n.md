## Formatting 
It's a good idea to read [this](https://crowdtilt.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=60850186) to understand how locale generally works on desktop/web

### Currencies
Our old approach of dealing with currency formatting is basically: format the number portion (commas/decimals) and paste on the currency symbol (as it would appear to someone from that region). This is oubviously wrong because every locale will see the currency symbol differently (```$1.0``` vs ```US$1.0``` vs ```1.0 $US```).
* Use our ```CurrencyFormatter``` utilities to format currencies either for display (without decimals if % 100 === 0), or as a price (decimals regardless)
* In react land, you can use ```UserPrice```, ```CampaignPrice``` and ```Price``` components for currency rendering. Internally they utilize ```CurrencyFormatter```
* Do not use accounting.js

### Dates
* Use our ```DateFormatter``` utilities (coming soon)
* Do not use moment.js

### Numbers
* Use our ```NumberFormatter``` utilities (coming soon) for rendering of any quantities, and so on
* Do not use ```toLocaleString``` directly as it depends on OS locale
* Do not use accounting.js
